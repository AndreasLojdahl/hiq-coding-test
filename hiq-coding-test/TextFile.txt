How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?

I didn't count the hours I spent. I am working fulltime for the momemnt and have been spending every evening over a week so I could guess It took about 16 - 18 hours. 
I had to look up alot on google to refresh up the memory on some things which took abit off time aswell.



Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

My solution was a controller which recieved a post request with a formdata body from the frontend. I have a service which checks file extension on the file to be of type ".txt" and some logic which extract most used word from uploaded textfile 
and returns an object with number of times the most used word have been used and the text with modifications towards the most used words. I have a very very basic frontend due to lack of time. 
Which basically selects a file from your desktop and post it to the api and prints out the response.



What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.

I would add more error handling. Check for multiple extensions instead of just ".txt". Handle "what if" scenarios. Check the textfile content for characters. That it only contains "A-Z" and not for example japanese letters. 
I would throw more specific errors with messages to be recived by the frontend and be shown as a message in the ui.  



What did you think of this recruitment test?
It was a good recruitment test. It was a good recap for me and got to try some new things like reading from a file. I just wish I had more time to be able to do more code and error handling. I just made it work and very basic
